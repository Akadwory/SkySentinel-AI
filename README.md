# SkySentinel AI – Global Intelligence Mesh

SkySentinel AI is a revolutionary, AI-powered global airspace and Earth intelligence system. Designed as a modular, multi-phase project, SkySentinel starts with real-time flight anomaly detection and evolves into a decentralized AI mesh capable of self-healing, synthetic training, swarm coordination, and satellite integration.

> This system is designed to shock the world and redefine how we perceive and defend our airspace.

## Project Overview

SkySentinel AI is built to scale from local air traffic monitoring to a full-fledged Earth-AI neural mesh. It integrates edge sensors, AI models, swarm coordination, federated learning, and quantum resilience.

### Key Features:
- Real-time anomaly detection on global flight data (OpenSky API)
- Scalable architecture: Kafka → PostgreSQL → ML → Streamlit
- Modular phases enabling multisensor fusion, drone detection, and synthetic adversarial training
- Neural interface support, swarm-aware intelligence, and self-evolving AI infrastructure

Getting Started (Local Simulated Mode)
You can run Phase 1 using simulated OpenSky data locally before going full-stream.

1. Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/Akadwory/SkySentinel-AI.git
cd SkySentinel-AI

2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run Data Ingestion (Simulated CSV)

python src/ingestion/fetch_simulated_data.py

4. Start Kafka + PostgreSQL (Optional Docker Setup)

docker-compose up

5. Launch Streamlit Dashboard

streamlit run src/visualization/app.py

Testing
Run all tests:

pytest tests/

Test logs and detailed validation cases can be found in:


docs/test_report.md
CI/CD integration for GitHub Actions is planned in Phase 2.
